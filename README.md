# Learning MongoDB

This is an example project where I am learning to work with MongoDB and Test-Driven Development. I am interested in full-stack JavaScript Engineering. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

*** I'm playing with Robomongo as well to view MongoDB with a GUI! ***


```
Homebrew
NodeJS/NPM
Nodemon
MongoDB
Mongoose
Mocha
ES6

Clone this repo, cd into the directory that was created when you cloned the repo and `npm install` - you should be good to go! 

To run the test type: npm run test

```
